# Technical Interview Review Cheat Sheets

This repo is for all UIUC ECE and CS students to come together and create review sheets as we prepare for technical interviews. Many of us have taken a core set of important classes (especially CS 225), and want a place to quickly glance at major topics from these classes (data structures, big O, etc).

We're starting out with ECE and CS classes, but this can certainly expand to other topics as well!

Initial List:
  1. CS 225 - Data Structures
  2. CS 374 - Algorithms
  3. ECE 391 / CS 241 - Computer Systems Engineering / Systems Programming
  4.
